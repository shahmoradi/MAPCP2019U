"Question: Which attributes of the course and/or the professor helped you learn the material? (When the course is next taught, what should be done in the same way?)",,,,,,,,,,,,
I liked having all the lectures posted online so I could read them both before and after class. This was very helpful. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Dr. Shahmoradi is very knowledgeable and kind. He is very helpful and spends time with us during office hours. I remember he once helped me for 1,2 hours to make sure I understood HW1, HW2, and GitHub website creation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Question: Which attributes or the course and/or the professor did not help you learn the material? (When the course is next taught, what might be revised?)",,,,,,,,,,,,
"We tended to move a little bit slowly because many students were not keeping up with the reading. I think we should have pushed on despite the fact some people were behind; the responsibility should be more on the students to keep up with the class, especially since the pace would have in no way been too fast. It would also have been nice to have more smaller homework problems for extra practice if we were really going to go as slow as we did.",,,,,,,,,,,,
None.,,,,,,,,,,,,
